# pagerank algorithm
4 implementations of Pagerank Algorithm

Pagerank.c is an implementation of simple pagerank algorithm based on the following paper
"Sepandar Kamvar, Taher Haveliwala, and Gene Golub. Adaptive methods for the computation of
PageRank.Linear Algebra and its Applications, 386(15):51â€“65, 2004."

Gauss-Seidel.c is another version of pagerank algorithm using the technique of Gauss-Seidel iterations
and it is based on the following paper "A PageRank Algorithm based on Asynchronous Gauss-Seidel Iterations,
Daniel Silvestre, Joao Hespanha and Carlos Silvestre."

The two papers can be found on the directory reports.

The other two files Omp_page_rank.c and Omp_Gauss_Seidel.c are the parallel versions of the previous ones
using OpenMP.
